This mod is a patch for the Rimhammer - The End Times - Beastmen mod. 

It removes race restrictions on all beastman buildings, and recipes. Therefore, it allows any RimWorld pawn with the required skill and skill level to build beastman stuff, or complete beastman recipes. Also allows non beastmen to wear beastmen apparel, and makes all weapons weildable by any one.

With this, you can have the ultimate savage human tribe playthrough.
